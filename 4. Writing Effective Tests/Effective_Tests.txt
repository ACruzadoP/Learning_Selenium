The 1st two advices for writting effective tests were too dump to be explained:
- Use Variables
- Use Functions


Now let's go with the one that I have considered as the most interesting so far:
- Page Object Pattern
    - A class for each page in the app
    - Each page has
        *Selectors
        *Methods


    In the example, the app has two pages: SignupPage and the UsersPage, so the I created the following files:
    - signup_page.rb
    - users_page_rb


        Free free to check out those files. To do so, go to the "Exercise Files > Ch03 > 03_03 > end"
