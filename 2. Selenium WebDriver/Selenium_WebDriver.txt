Here we go... it's Saturday btw... not working at Unit4 but I somehow got addicted to this Selenium thing xD

UPDATE: actually Sunday, yesterday was not the day I was going to hit the Play button. But got everything prepared!

WELL SO, in the last course I went for Selenium with python, this time it's time for Ruby I guess, as I was requested to install it...
but these are the supported languages: C, Java, Ruby, Python and JavaScript. 

Ass (xD) well as the Platforms and Browsers:

    - Platforms: macOS, Windows and Linux
    - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE and Safari (dunno about Edge)

        *Important thing: For each one of them, I need a different driver... 
            In the case of Ruby+Firefox, I need:
                Selenium WebDriver
                Geckodriver
            Wonder if I could make a matrix with all the combinations, to know what requirements to be considered all the time. 


        I wonder if the code of each script would be the same... as I could test the same thing on different browsers with the same 
        script... but it doesn't seem to...






The instructor is downloading Selenium Language bindings from here:
https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/

    - the one for Ruby. I wonder as I don't remember doing this with python, 
    at least not like that. Maybe cuz I used pip? xD
        Nvm, lets install everything. 






Now I know what a GEM is!!
------------------------------

Gems are the files that store ruby software, like packages. It was the 1st time working with Ruby so I didn't know this. 
    - Gems need to be installed befor using them. 
    - This is done with "gem install" or "bundler"
        to use "gem", Ruby needs to be installed. Good that we have covered that xD




Problem 1
-----------
After selecting the link to download the Ruby-related version of selenium, from above. 
I don't get to understand what I'm doing btw, but! Looks like the "gem" commands from the website need to be added to the code.

So the Instructor goes to the Exercise files > Ch01 > 01_02 > start > Gemfile
    and paste the following (acually, the following is what I copied from the same website - Video outdated)
        gem 'selenium-webdriver', '~> 4.8', '>= 4.8.1'

And you would be like... what't the problem? 
    1. What I paste doesn't match at all with what the Instructor pasted (to be reviewed in the 'Ch01 > 01_02 > end' folder)
    2. Why cannot I create my own Gemfile?
    3. The Instructor is using "bundler" to install the gems... but I don't want to install the freaking bundler. 

        Just in case I cannot do it on my way, this is how it's done, from the folder where the bundle is located:
            gem install bundler
            bundle install


END OF Problem
-------------------



The next thing the Instructor does (from now on "I"), is installing Geckodriver
    https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
    Selecting the latest one > Assets > Selecting the one for your OS
    She saved the file and didn't even finish with installing the freaking thing. 


    So unnecessarily complex!
