In this course, they test code will be written in Ruby. Thanksfully, I don't need to know Ruby to start the course...

To download Ruby, go to: 
    https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/


Also, the instructor will be using Firefox but I prefer sticking with Chrome... so no need to download it hopefully! 
Same goes with Sublime Text, the text editor chosen by the instructor. Why using that tool while having Visual Studio Code installed?
No clue xD

Btw! To know the ruby's version, go with "ruby -v" - right now, I have installed v.3.1.3p185... or something like that.
